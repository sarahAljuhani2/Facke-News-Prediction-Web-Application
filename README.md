# Facke-News-Prediction-Web-Application

Problem Statement:
In today's world, the spread of fake news has become a major concern. With the rise of social media, it has become easier than ever to disseminate false information. Fake news can have serious consequences, leading to misinformation, confusion, and even harm. Therefore, it is important to develop effective systems to identify and prevent the propagation of fake news.
Project Aim:
This project aims to create a fake news prediction web application that accurately classifies news articles as fake or not fake. It will be trained on a labeled dataset using machine learning techniques and deployed as a web application using Flask in Visual Studio Code.
Project Objectives:
•	Collect and pre-process the labeled dataset of news articles from Kaggle.
•	Explore and analyse the dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of fake and not fake news articles.
•	Build and train a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as fake or not fake.
•	Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
•	Deploy the model using Flask in Visual Studio Code as a web application, enabling users to verify the veracity of news articles in real time.
Description of the dataset: The dataset used for the fake news prediction system is a collection of news articles compiled in a CSV file. It originally consisted of 10,000 records, but after removing 36 duplicate records, the dataset contains 9,964 unique records. The dataset has 5 columns: title, text, subject, date, and class. The class column serves as the target variable, where 1 represents fake news and 0 represents not fake news [1].
